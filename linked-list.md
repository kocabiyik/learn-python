Linked lists are useful
when we need the access first and the last element of a collection.  

Traversing: Fancy way of saying looping in linked lists.  

## Stack
- Like real world stacked objects  
- You can only access element at the top.  
- If you need to access the second element from the top, you need to remove the element at the top.  
- LIFO
- Inserting on the top of the stack requires O(1) time.  

## Queue
- Like a real world queue.  
- Enqueue (entering the queue) and dequeue (exiting the queue).  
- Simulates the movement in one direction.  
- FIFO

## Graph
- Relationships between entities  
- Example: DAG
